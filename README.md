## Capstone Project – Data Analytics
---


This repository presents the full analysis for a capstone project investigating the relationship between **digital behavior, social media usage, and AI interactions** and **mental health outcomes** among Canadians. Utilizing the **Canadian Internet Use Survey (CIUS 2022) Public Microdata File (PUMF)**, we executed a comprehensive data pipeline: cleaning a custom 16-variable subset, performing extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, labeling and transforming categorical codes, and building interactive **Tableau dashboards** to derive insights. All code, cleaned datasets, analysis notebooks, and visual assets are included, paving the way for future **Machine Learning (ML) modeling** extensions.
